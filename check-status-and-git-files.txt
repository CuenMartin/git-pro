GIT STATUS 
- Git status is going to give us the status of any changes or any files that have been added to the folder
- but I could run the "git status" command and it will tell me that there are not files that are being tracked
- to track the files I will run the command "git add"

GIT ADD 

- so if I want to track the file of index.html then I will say "git add index.html"
- from there we need to commit the file since after you do git add it is waiting for you to commit it

GIT COMMIT 

- we will have to do something called git commit 
- git commit is saving the file at the exact time so we can go back and reference the changes 
- here is how I commit the file: git commit -am "I added a new file called html"
- now the changes will be saved and I can when I made the change and why I made the change 
- when I commit files I should be giving good deatials as to why the change has been made
- it will also say it has 12 insertion for example, insertion just means "how many lines I have in my file"
